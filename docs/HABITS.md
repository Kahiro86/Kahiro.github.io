# Habit tracker — progress

Moved into this repository from `Kahiro86/Gym-` and mounted as the
**Habits** module (sidebar, under The Man). What changed in the move and
what deliberately did not:

**Unchanged.** Every line of Layers 1, 2 and 3 — the Worker, the SQLite
schema and repository, the pure logic core, the three screens. All 307
unit tests and 141 browser acceptance tests pass, and only two test lines
were touched (both noted below).

**Changed, and why.**

- `src/ui/tokens.css` set its reset on `*`, `body` and `button`. As one
  module among a dozen, that would restyle every other one, so the whole
  sheet is now scoped to a `.habitapp` wrapper. The scoping is written
  with `:where()` so each rule keeps the specificity it had — see the
  note in that file; the first attempt raised the reset above the
  screens' own padding and collapsed the list.
- `main.tsx` became `HabitTracker.tsx`, a component rather than a root
  render. `standalone.tsx` + `habits.html` render the same component on
  its own page, in the same build; the acceptance suites drive that page
  rather than Kahiro's shell.
- Layer 1 gained nothing. Layer 2 gained nothing. The module still owns
  its own storage and reads none of Kahiro's habit state — the two run
  side by side until the migration lands.
- Acceptance test 21 (`new Date()` appears once) now scans
  `src/modules/habits` instead of `src/`. Kahiro's own modules call
  `new Date()` legitimately and were never in that rule's remit.
- One editor test addressed the storage panel by position; it addresses
  it by heading now, and a new test asserts the reset has not flattened
  the screens' spacing.

**Where things live.**

| | |
|---|---|
| Module | `src/modules/habits/` |
| Standalone page | `habits.html` → `/habits.html` |
| Unit tests | `tests/habits/unit/` — `npm run test:unit` |
| Acceptance suites | `tests/habits/acceptance/` — `npm run test:habits` |
| Typecheck | `npm run typecheck` (the habit module only) |

**The existing data comes with it, for free.** OPFS is scoped to the
origin, not the path, and the pool VFS uses its default directory. The old
deployment at `kahiro86.github.io/Gym-/` and this one at
`kahiro86.github.io/` are the same origin, so they open the same database
file — anything already logged in the Gym- build is already here, with no
import step. Verified by writing a habit at one path and reading it back
at the other in the same browser profile.

The corollary is that the two must not be open at the same time. Layer 1b
takes a Web Lock and refuses a second writer with an explanation rather
than risking corruption, so whichever page loads second shows that notice.
Once the old deployment is retired the question disappears.

Everything below is the tracker as it stood in its own repository.

# Progress

Layers are built strictly bottom-up. A layer is not "done" until its gate
has been reported and cleared.

## Layer 1 — data — DONE
SQLite/WASM in a Web Worker. Schema, migrations, validation, typed errors,
the 4am day-start, the tri-state entry model, `UNIQUE(habit_id, date)`.
32/32 acceptance tests (spec tests 1-31).

The revised data spec added tests 32-60 — concurrency, volume and query
plans, hostile input, calendar edge cases, migration robustness,
durability. 32/32 in `tests/acceptance/layer1-extended.mjs`. Eight real
bugs were found and fixed getting there; see below.

## Layer 2 — logic — DONE
Scores, streaks, trends, history, heatmap, and the three screens' view
models. Pure core plus a thin async facade, so the arithmetic is testable
without a browser. Layer 1 and Layer 2 together have 245 unit tests; Layer 2
has 17 integration tests.

## Layer 3 — UI
- Screen 1 (list) — DONE
- Screen 2 (detail) — DONE
- Screen 3 (calendar) — DONE
- Habit editor — DONE. **Not in the build spec**, which describes three
  read screens and no way to create a habit, so the "+" had nothing
  behind it and the app could only ever be empty. Create, edit, archive
  and delete, reached from the "+", the empty state and the detail
  screen's pencil.
- Screen 1's filter and overflow menus — DONE. Also not in the spec,
  which draws both icons but defines no behaviour. Filter: show archived,
  hide done today. Overflow: new group, the day-start hour, and where the
  data is stored.
- Deployed to GitHub Pages, gated on the full test suite.

## Layer 1b — sync — IN PROGRESS

### Done
- **§3.1 VFS swap.** `opfs-sahpool` instead of the default `opfs` VFS. No
  SharedArrayBuffer, no COOP/COEP, so the app runs on GitHub Pages. SQLite,
  the schema, every query and every constraint unchanged. See STORAGE.md,
  including why this rather than the spec's `IDBBatchAtomicVFS`.
- **Web Lock + persistence.** A second tab is refused with a truthful
  message rather than a raw handle error; `navigator.storage.persist()` is
  requested on first run and its answer surfaced.
- **§4 schema.** Migration 2 adds `user_id`, `deleted_at` and
  `sync_status` to all three tables, creates `sync_queue`, seeds
  `device_id`, and backfills the queue for rows that predate it.
- **§6 tombstones.** `deleteEntry`, `deleteHabit` and `deleteRoutine` set
  `deleted_at`. Every read filters it out, so Layer 2's contract is
  unchanged. Purge at 90 days, only for rows the server has acknowledged.
- **§7 sync engine.** Push drains the queue in order with per-row
  outcomes and exponential backoff; pull is incremental on `last_pull_at`;
  conflicts resolve last-write-wins on `updated_at` with the server
  winning ties, never merging. Triggers on start, reconnect, mutation
  (debounced 2s) and a 5-minute timer.
- **§7.5** `SyncConflictError`.
- **§8** `getSyncState()` and `getPendingCount()`, and nothing else.
- **§5 Postgres.** `supabase/schema.sql` — schema parity, `date` as TEXT,
  RLS forced on from the start, an `updated_at` trigger so a client cannot
  win a conflict by lying, the `v_daily_completions` view for Kahiro's
  reads and the `habit_log_entry` RPC for its writes.

### Not done
- **Running `supabase/schema.sql` against the real project.** There are no
  credentials in this environment. The SQL is reviewed, not executed.
- **§9.4 tests 17-22** — RLS with two accounts, `user_id` spoofing, the
  Kahiro view, direct-write denial, RPC validation, RPC round-trip. All
  six need real Postgres and two real accounts. Running them against a
  fake would prove nothing about the claim being made.
- **Signing in.** The engine reads its URL and key from the build and
  needs an access token and user id to become active. Until then it is
  inert and `getSyncState()` reports `offline`, which is the truth: there
  is nowhere for the queue to drain to. Local writes keep working and keep
  queueing.

### Test results

| Suite | Result |
|---|---|
| Layer 1 acceptance (1-31) | 32/32 |
| Layer 1 extended (32-60) | 32/32 |
| Layer 2 integration | 17/17 |
| Layer 2 and Layer 1 unit | 307/307 |
| Storage (§9.2) | 6/6 |
| Sync (§9.2-9.3) | 11/11 |
| Editor and Screen 1 | 26/26 |
| Backup (Layer 2b §5) | 8/8 |
| Layer 2b acceptance (15-24) | 9/9 |
| Supabase (§9.4) | not run — no project |

Every Layer 2 source and test that existed before Layer 1b is byte-identical
to what it was then — that is §9.1's requirement, and it holds. Layer 2 has
since *gained* `editor.ts` and 38 unit tests, which is an addition for
the habit editor, not a change to anything Layer 1b touched.

## Bugs the revised Layer 1 spec found

Each of these was live, and none was caught by the previous 31 tests.

1. **Dates were validated by regex only.** `2026-02-30`, `2026-13-01`,
   `2027-02-29` and `2026-04-31` all matched `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` and
   were stored. Once written, no later check could say what the user
   meant. `src/db/dates.ts` now checks the real calendar, including the
   century rule — `2100-02-29` is rejected, `2000-02-29` is not.
2. **`Infinity` was storable as an entry value.** Only `NaN` was checked.
   One stored infinity poisons every sum computed from it.
3. **Negative values were storable.** They have no meaning in this model:
   a day not done is `0`, an unlogged day has no row.
4. **`transaction(fn)` was missing entirely**, though spec §5 requires
   it. Multi-write operations had no way to be atomic.
5. **Transactions could not nest.** Adding `runTransaction` exposed it
   immediately: every mutation already opens its own transaction for the
   sync queue, and SQLite refuses a nested `BEGIN`. Inner writes now join
   the outer transaction, which is also the correct semantics.
6. **A newer database would be opened and written by older code.** Now
   refused, with both version numbers in the message.
7. **Quota failures surfaced untyped**, so the UI could not tell "storage
   is full" from a constraint violation. Now `QuotaExceededError`.
8. **An evicted database was indistinguishable from a new one.** Someone
   whose browser cleared their history would have been shown "No habits
   yet". A marker outside the database now makes the two distinguishable,
   and the list says so plainly.

## Layer 2b — logic enhancement — DONE

Additive throughout: no Layer 2 function changed its signature, and the
whole pre-Layer-2b Layer 2 suite passes unmodified.

- **B1 export/import.** `logic/backup.ts` — `exportAll`, `validateImport`
  (reports every problem in one pass, catches foreign-key and unique
  violations before writing, refuses a file from a newer schema),
  `importAll`, `backupFilename`. Layer 1 gained `exportRows` /
  `importData`, one transaction, replace requiring explicit confirmation
  and merge keeping the newer `updated_at`. Reachable from the overflow
  menu.
- **B2 frequency shapes.** `logic/frequency.ts` — `getFrequencyShape`
  splits `daily`/`specific_days` (scheduled) from
  `times_per_week`/`times_per_month` (quota). Quota periods are Mon-Sun
  weeks or calendar months; streaks count periods, not days; a period
  still running can never have been broken. Five branch points in
  `core.ts`, each commented, so no quota habit ever runs through
  scheduled-habit logic.
- **B3 at_most.** `allowsExplicitMiss` is false for a numeric `at_most`
  habit — a zero is a perfect day, so a tri-state "mark as missed" would
  be a lie. The menu item is hidden for those habits.
- **B4 boundaries.** `computeScoreOrNull` returns null where a score is
  unknowable instead of 0, and clamps the window to today so days that
  have not happened cannot sit in the denominator.
- **B5/B7 aggregates.** `logic/aggregates.ts` —
  `getScheduledHabitsForDate`, `getCompletionsForDate`,
  `getDayCompletionRate`, `getHabitsSummary`, `getAggregateScore`,
  `getStreakAtDate`, `getCompletionsSince`. Every whole-list read is a
  fixed number of statements; the acceptance suite measures that rather
  than asserting it.
- **B6 caching.** `logic/cache.ts`, keyed on
  `(habitId, fn, args, writeCounter)`. Layer 1 bumps the counter inside
  each write's own transaction, so a rolled-back write leaves the cache
  correct. A pull drops the cache entirely, announced by Layer 1 and
  acted on in `main.tsx` — Layer 1 still does not know a cache exists.

## Next
Supabase provisioning, then the remaining §9.4 tests. §7.4 is still open:
how Kahiro's XP engine ingests `getCompletionsSince` is not specified, so
only the habit app's side of that boundary is built.

---

## Deviations from the specs, logged rather than absorbed

1. **`@sqlite.org/sqlite-wasm` instead of `wa-sqlite`** (Layer 1 gate).
   The npm package named `wa-sqlite` is an unofficial, proprietary-licensed
   republish, a year behind. This is the SQLite project's own build.
2. **`opfs-sahpool` instead of `IDBBatchAtomicVFS`** (Layer 1b §3.1).
   `IDBBatchAtomicVFS` belongs to wa-sqlite and is not available here;
   adopting it would mean swapping SQLite distributions, the opposite of
   the small diff §3.1 asks for. The pool VFS meets every stated
   requirement and is faster. Trade-off: it needs OPFS with
   `createSyncAccessHandle` (Chrome 108+, Safari 17+, Firefox 111+),
   where IndexedDB would have been universal. Full reasoning in STORAGE.md.
3. **The Web Lock excludes a second tab rather than serializing it**
   (§3.1). The pool VFS holds exclusive handles, so two tabs genuinely
   cannot both write. The no-corruption guarantee holds; the second tab is
   refused with an explanation instead of queued.
4. **`user_id` is nullable in the local schema**, NOT NULL in Postgres
   (§4.1). There is no session before first sign-in, and a placeholder id
   would be fabricated data.
5. **Layer 1 acceptance tests 30 and 31 were edited.** They asserted
   `schema_version === "1"`, which §4's migration 2 makes false by design;
   a hardcoded 1 asserts the schema never advances. They now assert the
   latest version and additionally check `device_id` and `last_pull_at`.
   No other test in any suite was touched. This is the only exception to
   §9.1's "unmodified", and it is a conflict between §9.1 and §4 rather
   than a weakened test.
6. **Test counts differ from the spec's.** §9.1 cites 138 Layer 2 unit
   tests and 17 integration tests; the suite has 198 and 17. The tests
   were rewritten during the Opus 5 rebuild, and the editor and Screen 1's
   menus added 38
   more. The binding requirement — the pre-Layer-1b Layer 2 tests pass
   with zero edits to Layer 2 — holds.
7. **A habit editor was added, which no spec describes.** The build spec
   defines three read screens; without a way to create a habit the app
   is permanently empty, which is what shipped. Layer 2 gained
   `editor.ts` (draft shape, validation, write passthroughs) so the new
   screen still imports only from Layer 2.
8. **CalendarScreen called `db.deleteEntry` directly**, bypassing Layer 2
   — a boundary violation from the Screen 3 work. It now goes through
   Layer 2's `deleteEntry`.
9. **A scheduled day that ended without being done shows a dash.** Loop
   leaves it entirely blank, which is indistinguishable from a day the
   habit was never due, and reads as though the cell is still waiting
   after the day has closed. Layer 2 gained a `lapsed` cell state for
   exactly this; `blank` now means only "not scheduled". Storage is
   unchanged — there is still no row, and an explicit miss (value 0) is
   still a separate state shown as an x.
10. **The filter and overflow buttons do something.** The spec draws both
    and defines neither. Rendering a control that does nothing is worse
    than not drawing it, and they were reported as broken.
11. **`transaction(fn)` is `runTransaction(ops)`** (§5). A callback
    cannot cross the Worker boundary, and passing a live transaction
    handle to the main thread would hold it open across a postMessage
    round trip — long enough to block another tab. Operations are named
    instead, and only repository writes are transactable.
12. **Date bounds are deliberately unbounded** (§9.10 test 52). 1970 and
    2099 both store; lexicographic order stays chronological for any
    four-digit year, so no limit is needed and any chosen one would be
    arbitrary.
13. **Tapping a measurable habit's cell asks for the amount in place**,
    rather than opening the detail screen. The original reasoning — a tap
    cannot invent an amount — was right, but navigating away meant the
    app's central gesture did nothing on a measurable habit. Only the
    habit's name navigates now.
14. **Layer 1 gained `getFirstEntryDates`.** §5 requires the whole-list
    reads to be batched, and `effectiveStart` needs each habit's first
    logged day; asking per habit made `getHabitsSummary` cost one Worker
    round trip per row. Adding a batched read to Layer 1 is what its own
    boundary rule prescribes — a query upstairs would not have been.
15. **`dayKey` moved into `core.ts`.** Three call sites built the same
    habit-and-date key inline and one of them used a different separator,
    which silently matched nothing. There is now one function, and
    `aggregates.ts` no longer carries literal NUL bytes in its source.
16. **One editor test's selector was updated.** It read the storage
    section as `.sheet__section` `.last()`, and B1 appended a Backup
    section below it, so it began reading the wrong element. It now
    addresses the section by its heading. The assertion is unchanged —
    the storage line must still name the VFS.
17. **`cache.test.ts` exists because the acceptance suite cannot force
    one interleaving.** Test 21 proves the running app never serves a
    stale streak, but the Worker's queue decides the order, so the exact
    write-during-compute window is not reachable from a browser test. The
    unit test holds `compute` open and moves the counter underneath it.
