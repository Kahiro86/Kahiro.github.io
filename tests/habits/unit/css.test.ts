// Guards against a defect that shipped: HabitEditor.css defined `.row`,
// ListScreen.css already used `.row` for a habit row, and every
// stylesheet is bundled into one document. The editor's `display: flex`
// won on source order and collapsed the habit grid — names squashed to a
// letter, day cells no longer under their column headers.
//
// Nothing caught it. Typecheck cannot see CSS, and every screen still
// rendered, so the acceptance suites passed against a visibly broken
// list. These files are hand-written CSS rather than modules, so the
// discipline that replaces scoping is: a class belongs to exactly one
// stylesheet, unless it is deliberately shared.
